DSOXLAN
=======

This is a simple Ethernet interface-card for Agilent/Keysight
DSO-X 2000 and 3000 series oscilloscopes. The original Agilent/Keysight 
DSOXLAN module (about 326 euros + VAT as of December 2014)
also includes VGA output, while this simple card provides only LAN.

Many thanks to "georges80" on the EEVBlog forum
for the original schematic and PCB layout.
